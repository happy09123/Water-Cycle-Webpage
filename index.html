                    is the continuous movement of water between the Earth's atmosphere and surface.

                    <p>
                        “ The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, 
                        is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. 
                        It involves processes like evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff, 
                        which work together to circulate water throughout the environment. ”

                    <h3>.. How does evaporation contribute to the water cycle?</h3>
                    <p>
                        “ Evaporation is the process where water from 
                        oceans, rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water absorbs heat from the sun and turns into water vapor. 
                        This vapor rises into the atmosphere, playing a crucial role in moving water from the Earth’s surface into the air. ”

                    <p>
                        “ Condensation occurs when water vapor in the air cools down and changes back into liquid droplets, forming clouds. 
                        This process is essential for cloud formation and helps in the eventual return of water to the Earth’s surface through precipitation. ”

                    <p>
                        “ Precipitation happens when cloud particles combine to form larger droplets that fall to the Earth due to gravity. 
                        This can occur in various forms, such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, depending on the temperature and atmospheric conditions. ”

                    <h3>.. What is the role of plants in the water cycle?</h3>
                    <p>
                        “ Plants contribute to the water cycle through transpiration, 
                        where they absorb water from the soil and release it as water vapor through their leaves. 
                        This process adds moisture to the atmosphere and works alongside evaporation to maintain atmospheric water vapor levels. ”

                <div class="sixth">
                    <h3>.. How does water return to the oceans and rivers?</h3>
                    <p>
                        “ Water returns to oceans and rivers through runoff and infiltration. 
                        Runoff is the flow of water over the land’s surface, while infiltration is the process where water seeps into the ground, 
                        replenishing underground water reserves and aquifers. ”

                    <h3>.. Why is the water cycle important for life on Earth?</h3>
                    <p>
                        “ The water cycle is vital for sustaining life on Earth as it distributes fresh water across the planet, 
                        supports plant growth, regulates climate, and maintains ecosystems. 
                        It ensures that water is continuously recycled and available for all living organisms. ”

                    <h3>.. How does the water cycle affect weather and climate?</h3>
                    <p>
                        “ The water cycle influences weather and climate by regulating temperature and humidity levels. 
                        Processes like evaporation and condensation release and absorb heat, driving atmospheric circulation and affecting weather patterns. 
                        Precipitation also plays a key role in determining local climate conditions. ”
